# VCV-Rack-v2-Testing-Plugins
Mac builds of VCV Rack v2 plugins

Here are the macOS builds for some plugins compatible with the new version (v2) of VCV Rack CE.
These have all been built against VCV Rack Community Edition 2.git.b04e4117

## Befaco
This is [hemmer's](https://github.com/hemmer) [dev branch](https://github.com/hemmer/Befaco) of the Befaco plugin including some cool new additions (like Morphader!).
I had to remove Muxlicer and Mex for now, as they were generating errors when trying to build for v2.
